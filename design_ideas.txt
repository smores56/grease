For filtering event type, add a drop-down menu in the top right to filter that way, and load all events each time.
For each set of data (events, songs, etc.) don't need to ever reload the page (keep add, delete, view on same load with js / jquery).
Use GaTech / Glee Club color schemes. (Make it look unique!)
